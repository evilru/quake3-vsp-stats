vsp stats processor - vsp(c) 2004-2005 by myrddin(myrddin8 <AT> gmail <DOT> com)
================================================================================

vsp stats processor is a multi game - log analyzer/stats generator/log parser. 
It can process log files from several games including Quake 3 Arena (q3a), 
Halflife 1, 2, Counter Strike Source (hl), Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory (wet), 
Return to Castle Wolfenstein (rtcw), Call Of Duty, COD: United Offensive (cod), 
Medal of Honor Allied Assault, MOHAA: Spearhead, MOHAA: BreakThrough (moh), 
Soldier of Fortune 2 (sof2), etc. It reads the log files generated by a game 
and displays various game statistics. vsp also supports both server logs (ex:- 
games.log for Q3A) and client logs (ex:- qconsole.log for Q3A).

Installation and Usage Instructions:
================================================================================

   
   0. requirements
      ------------
   
      - php (http://www.php.net) - version 4
      - mysql (http://www.mysql.com)
      - a php compatible web server (http://www.apache.org)
      - a web browser (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/)

      vsp uses php and mysql to store and retrieve stats, so you need to
      install both php and mysql on your server/system.
      You may also need a webserver that is compatible with php if you dont 
      already have one. Apache is a good one and is the recommended web server.
      php, mysql and apache can be downloaded and used for free.
      Download the latest version of the php, mysql & apache(or another webserver)

      php can be downloaded from http://www.php.net
      mysql can be downloaded from http://www.mysql.com
      apache can be downloaded from http://www.apache.org
      You can also get a free webserver from http://www.xitami.com , which may be
      easier to setup than apache.

      Install the webserver first. In windows, the PHP setup program can 
      automatically detect the webserver and configure it accordingly.
      Install mysql and php on your system.

      Check the installation instructions that comes with php, mysql and apache, 
      for further instructions. 

      http://www.google.com is a good resource as well.

      It is recommended that you run php as a module from apache.
   
   
   1. mysql setup
      -----------
   
      If you already have a mysql username/password/hostname/database set up,
      then you may skip this step. Usually your website host will provide you
      with this information. 
   
   a. Read the section (section 5?) that deals with MySQL Database 
      Administration from the mysql manual which can be found C:/mysql/Docs or
      online at http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Adding_users.html or
      http://www.mysql.com
      This section deals with user priveleges and tells you how to make mysql
      more secure and add a new user etc. You can simplify this process using
      an application called MySQL Control Center which can be found at
      http://www.mysql.com/products/mysqlcc/index.html

      You need to setup a user AND a password in mysql. If you are planning
      to run mysql as user 'root' then you have to set up a password for user 
      'root' if it isn't already setup.
      
      The following is from the mysql documentation:-
      
      
          The default privileges on Windows give all local users full privileges 
          to all databases without specifying a password. To make MySQL more 
          secure, you should set a password for at least the root accounts. 
          You should also remove the row in the mysql.user table that has 
          Host='localhost' and User=''. This account allows anonymous access 
          but has full privileges, so removing it improves security.

          The following example shows how to remove the anonymous-user account 
          that has all privileges, and then assigns a password to the root 
          accounts:
          
          C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql -u root mysql
          mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE Host='localhost' AND User='';
          mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
          mysql> QUIT
          C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root password "newpwd"
          C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root -h host_name password "newpwd"

          Replace "newpwd" with the actual root password that you want to use. 
          The double quotes are not always necessary, but they are helpful if 
          the password contains spaces or other characters that are special 
          to your command interpreter. In the second mysqladmin command, 
          replace host_name with the name of the server host. 
      
      
      If you are running mysql as root, you *MUST* have a root password set up
      as indicated above
      
      Test to see if you can load up mysql with the username and the password
      you have set up. Open up a command prompt and do the following:

        mysql -u Username -pPassword

      Note: Username = your username
            Password = your password
            There is no space between the -p and your password

      If it goes to the mysql> prompt, mysql is properly set up on your system.
      Quit mysql by typing QUIT in the mysql> prompt and that should return to 
      the command prompt.
      
        mysql> QUIT
      
      Close the command prompt window.
      
      Further help on how to set up mysql can be found at http://www.mysql.com
 
 
   2. php setup
      ---------
      
      If you already have php set up on your host then you may skip this step. 
   
   a. The following step is not required but it is recommended to make things
      easier. If you dont do the following, then you have to type the full
      php path whenever you want to execute vsp. (i.e. Instead of typing
      php vsp.php, you have to type C:/php/php vsp.php.
   
      Add the php command path (c:/php/ is the default) to your 
      environment variable PATH.
      In windows 2000/XP you can specify the PATH in
      start->
        settings->
          control panel->
            system->
              advanced->
                environment variables->
                  user variables->
                    PATH
      In win9x versions, you can specify the PATH in autoexec.bat:
        Path=C:\Windows;C:\Windows\Command;c:\php;
      
      i.e, when you type php -v from the command prompt (from any directory), 
           it should display the php version you have installed.
      Test it! Open up a command prompt window, and from C:\ or any other 
      directory, type php -v and press enter. It should display your php version.
      
   
   b. Make sure you have configured your webserver to intercept .php files.
      This should automatically be done by the php installation program. Read
      the ReadMe file that comes with php. You may have to configure some things
      manually depending on the webserver you have on your system.
      
      ***WARNING*** If php is not set up properly, your username/password for 
                    mysql may be compromised!
      
      There is a file called test.php in this distribution under the pub 
      sub-folder. After setting up php, start your webserver and configure it
      to give public access to the pub folder. Then load up the test.php file
      using your internet browser. If php is set up properly, you should see
      a whole lot of tables with variables and its values. If instead you see a
      line saying that "php is not set up properly" followed by "phpinfo();",
      then php is not set up properly! Once you confirm php is working properly,
      you can and should delete the test.php file from your system (more secure).
  
      Further help on how to set up php can be found at http://www.php.net
 
 
   3. vsp setup
      ---------
      
      If you installed mysql, php, apache or another webserver or made any 
      changes to your system configuration, its a good idea to reboot your 
      system before you continue any further.

   a.  i) Download the vsp core zip file and extract it to a folder of your choice.
   
      ii) Download all the game media zip files that you want vsp to work with and 
          extract to the same folder you chose in step (3a.i), overwriting existing 
          files if necessary. If there is no media file for the game you are 
          looking for, you can ignore this step. 

   b. Open up pub/configs/cfg-default.php file using a text editor and 
      specify your mysql database username, password and other preferences. 
      Further decription of what each setting in the cfg file mean, can be
      found in cfg-default.php itself. Before you start parsing the logs, you 
      must make sure that you set the variable $cfg['game']['name'] in the config
      file properly. Read the comments beside that variable in cfg-default.php
      
   c. To analyze a log file and generate stats
      
      There are two available methods to update your stats:-
      
       i) If you have command line shell access to server where you installed vsp...
      
          Lets say you want to generate stats from a log file for Quake 3 Arena and
          your games.log file is in c:/games/quake iii arena/osp/
          To analyze this file, go to the directory where you unzipped vsp and type:

            php vsp.php -l q3a-osp "c:/games/quake iii arena/osp/games.log"

      ii) If you dont have command line shell access...
      
          You have to run vsp.php using your web browser ( Firefox is good - 
          http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ :D ).
          Inorder to run vsp via your web browser, you will require a password.
          There is a file called "password.inc.php" in the main vsp folder.
          You must edit this file using a text editor and choose a password that
          is atleast six character long to enable web access to vsp.php
          Make sure you upload the edited "password.inc.php" to the web server.
          
          Lets say you want to generate stats from a Quake 3 Arena log file called 
          games.log that you transferred to the vsp folder on the server
          
          To analyze this file, load http://www.YourServer.com/vsp/vsp.php?mode=web
          (ofcourse this url and path will depend on your website host and wherever 
          you uploaded VSP to on the web server) in your web browser, then
          Enter 
            -l q3a-osp "games.log"
          into the first text box following the phrase "php vsp.php". 
          Make sure to enter the password below as well.
          Hit the "Submit (Process Stats)" button.
  
   d. If you want to access your stats from the www, give public access to the
      pub/themes, pub/games and pub/images subfolder including its sub-directories 
      using your webserver. NOTE:- if you still get access problems try giving 
      public access to the entire pub/ folder.
      
      The default theme that php uses is pub/themes/bismarck/index.php
      index.php is the main stats webpage. If no config file is specified,
      index.php reads cfg-default.php and uses the information in that to access
      the mysql stats database. You can make several different php config files
      with different database settings and other preferences and tell index.php
      to read your preferences from the specified config file. All the config 
      files should be put in pub/configs/ folder
      
      ex: If you have a config file called cfg-myconfig.php with your 
          preferences, then you can tell index.php to read from that config 
          file by accessing:
          
            themes/bismarck/index.php?config=cfg-myconfig.php
      
      You can customize the theme further by editing pub/themes/bismarck/settings.php

    -p [parserOptions]                                                         

       savestate       1                                                       
                         disable/enable savestate processing                   
                         (remembers previously scanned logs and events)        
                         If this option is enabled, VSP will remember the      
                         location in the log file where the last stats was     
                         parsed from. So the next time VSP is run with the     
                         savestate 1 option against the same log file, it will 
                         start parsing the stats from the previous saved       
                         location.                                             
                         If you want VSP to forget this save state, then you   
                         have to delete the corresponding save state file from 
                         the logdata/ folder. The name is in the format        
                         savestate_[special_Form_Of_Logfile_Name]              
                         Deleting that file and running VSP again with         
                         savestate 1 option will reparse the whole log again   
                         from the beginning. Also note that each logfile will  
                         have a separate save state file under the logdata     
                         folder. Do not edit/modify the savestate files! If    
                         you dont want it, just delete it.                     

       check ReadME or first few lines of a particular parser php for other    
       valid options for that particular parser                                

    [logFilename] could be an FTP link/url. Set FTP username/password in config
    [logFilename] may be a logDirectory for some games. ex:- *HalfLife*        

    Usage: php vsp.php [options] [-p parserOptions] [logFilename]              
    Example: php vsp.php -l q3a -p savestate 1 "c:/quake iii arena/games.log"

       situations. Thanks Lukey.


24 Feb 2005 - v0.44 (beta)
--------------------------

- fix: -p savestate 1 routine for write access check for logdata/ folder.
- fix: Game start date/time for some games/mods (ETPRO) were wrong sometimes.
- fix: Disabled q3 style color codes for MOH. There are no color codes for MOH?
- fix: suppressed some annoying warning messages.


18 Feb 2005 - v0.43 (beta)
--------------------------

- fix: Valid kills getting counted as team kills in Call of Duty DM gametype.
       Thanks Ragnarius & Mike.


08 Feb 2005 - v0.42 (beta)
--------------------------

- fix: Kills not getting counted during "single team" gametypes (death match) 
       in some games (q3a,rtcw,wet,sof2). This bug was introduced in 0.41 when
       the Call of Duty kill/teamkill issue was fixed.
       

04 Feb 2005 - v0.41 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: You can specify some basic conditions for listing of players in the main
       index.php using variable $settings['display']['playerlist_conditions']
       in settings.php. ex:- setting that variable to "games>=10" will display
       only players with at least 10 games played.
- add: Stat for the first killer and victim in a game.
- add: $cfg['ftp']['overwrite'] option to config for overwriting existing logs 
       during FTP remote download.
- add: Misc. changes / verbose messages to minimize user errors.
- fix: Valid kills getting counted as team kills in rare occasions in cod.
- fix: Disabled team assignment in MOH which was causing problems because the
       logs dont output proper teams when player auto joins. This change 
       should fix most of the problems with wrong stats. However, team kills 
       cannot be detected anymore...
- fix: Team deaths getting counted in Kills/Deaths in Easiest Prey/Worst Enemy.
       Thanks Lukey.
- fix: -l q3a-osp Clan Arena parsing
- fix: COD color codes.
- fix: FTP remote downloading did not ignore named pipes, sockets etc and 
       created duplicate files to download list. Thanks Arzka.


02 Jan 2005 - v0.40 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: various database and query optimization. Should result in smaller db 
       size and faster db access. You have to reset current stats and reparse 
       the logs.
- add: sortable fields in playerstat.php etc. Thanks to the DOM script by 
       Stuart Langridge. http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/
- add: workaround for hl2 dm where kill lines are missing the weapon used.
- add: workaround for cod where kill lines are improperly logged with the 
       wrong client id. Seems to be happening in BAS gametypes only. The guid 
       in the damage line is also wrong but that shouldn't affect VSP.
       The workaround should work in most cases. The cod engine has to log this
       properly for a complete fix.
- add: HalfLife Team scoring and Player roles,icons etc, if available.
- add: Added -n option to vsp.php. If used, vsp will not ask for confirmation
       for certain actions you specify like reset database etc. ex:-
       php vsp.php -n -a clear_db
       will clear the database right away and will not prompt for y/n? input.
- add: more verbose messages when using FTP remote downloading of logs. 
- add: misc html fine-tuning
- chg: all the skin files have been updated to be more flexible.
- chg: simplified banlist specification. 
       Look in pub/include/playerBanList-default.inc.php
- chg: Easiest Preys / Worst Enemies is now based on a mix of both kills (or 
       deaths) AND efficiency. The topmost players are first retrieved based on 
       highest kills (or deaths) AND that limited result is then sorted by 
       efficiency. This may seem to not work properly in the beginning when 
       there aren't many players in the database. However, it should get better 
       as more games get logged. Also, you can no longer be your own 
       easiest prey / worst enemy.
- chg: Awards in playerstat.php is listed in a different, more readable way.
- fix: Potential security issue in vsp.php web mode.
- fix: -l hl: HalfLife pathname appearing in game type/mod in gameslist
- fix: -l hl: HalfLife player vs player actions parsed properly now.
- fix: -l hl: PreMatch events are ignored now. Log must indicate match start 
       with the line - World triggered "Match_Begins_Now"
- fix: Remote downloading skipped the first log in a directory. affected hl.
- fix: vsp.php errors out when log file or ftp link is specified in double 
       quotes in web mode. It should work with or without double quotes now.


10 Dec 2004 - v0.36 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: misc html fine-tuning
- add: Player quotes in playerstat.php will only show if
       $settings['display']['quotes'] is set to a value other than 0.
       Quotes with a number or @ symbol in it are ignored now as well.
- fix: erroneous stats when player renames and tracking by playerName. This was 
       quite a major bug. The bug affected the stats of all players that 
       interacted with the renamed player. So everyone should update to this 
       version for accurate stats. Hopefully its fixed now but need to test 
       this more.
- fix: playerName/alias not working properly. Name Search did not work sometimes
- fix: Better detection routine for vsp.php web access mode. You can also force 
       web mode by accessing vsp.php?mode=web
- fix: force skin to default_skin when $settings['display']['skin_selector'] is
       disabled.
- fix: misc html fixes


02 Dec 2004 - v0.35 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: a visible default award image.
- add: wet: Merged a few enemy territory weapons.
- fix: some character decoding problems in html and misc html fine-tuning
- fix: q3a-xp: Filtered out the client number and sound wav macros in chat 
       messages in excessive plus mod.
- fix: q3a-xp: freeze tag thaw event being counted as kill. Thanks DeeXGod.
- fix: sof2: player name colors should work properly now.


28 Nov 2004 - v0.34 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: Player Awards are now shown in the player profile as well.
- add: Player count in Games Stats List
- add: Better Tooltips. Thanks to the nice DOM Tooltip Library by Dan Allen.
       http://www.mojavelinux.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=127
       Added option to enable/disable this feature in settings.php
- add: More workarounds for HalfLife 2, Counter Strike Source Logs. Seems the 
       source logs are missing more stuff than I initially thought. Hopefully,
       VSP should compensate for everything now.
- add: -p savestate 1 option for HalfLife engine
       If the option is enabled, vsp will remember previousely scanned logs and
       will not parse them again.
- chg: -p livelog option has been renamed to -p savestate. Using livelog will 
       also work for now, but may be disabled in future releases. So get used to
       using -p savestate 1 instead of -p livelog 1.
- chg: disabled -p backup option. No longer needed?
- chg: changed internal adodb from pub/adodb/ to pub/lib/adodb/. If you update
       to this version without a clean install, then you can delete your existing
       pub/adodb/ folder, if there is one. Also updated adodb to version 4.54
- fix: Improved ftp remote downloading of logs. You can now specify a directory
       or a single file to download. If the ftp path supplied by the user ends 
       with a / or a \, then its assumed to be a directory and all the files 
       inside that directory will be downloaded (non-recursive). So remote 
       downloading of logs should work properly with games like Half life which 
       has separate logs for each game.
- fix: playerstats.php display problems in IE (Internet Explorer sucks!).


23 Nov 2004 - v0.33 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: Support for HalfLife 2, Counter Strike Source Logs. Use -l hl option.
       CS Source logs are in similar format as the original HalfLife logs. 
       However, there are some missing entries in the logs of the source
       engine, but they should be compensated for by VSP now and should work 
       fine. So for both the original Counter Strike and Counter Strike:Source 
       or any other HalfLife 1 or 2 mods, use the -l hl option.
- add: HalfLife 1 & 2 Player Tracking by Player name and GUID(steam_id/won_id)
- add: Default media for MOH.
- add: q3a accuracies in old OSP format are read properly now.
- add: q3a-osp clan arena gametype support. 
       You must use the -l q3a-osp option, gamename must contain osp and
       g_gametype must be 5 in the InitGame: string for this to take effect.
- add: Merged a few more COD weapons and added a workaround for wrong team 
       assignment by COD engine in dm games (its in the damage line in the log).
- add: More display configuration options to settings.php
- chg: Removed the last few of remaining game media from the vsp core zip.
       All of the game media packs has been updated as well. Some of the media 
       were also moved to different paths for consistency.
- fix: Award Description in Awards page not displayed when colors are disabled.
- fix: config variable was not saved when browsing through gamestat.php list
       

19 Nov 2004 - v0.32 (beta)
--------------------------

- fix: COD log parsing logic was wrong. Hopefully I got it right this time!
       Thanks Dirtneck & jtripper.
- fix: q3a excessive plus accuracies for certain weapons merged properly.


18 Nov 2004 - v0.31 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: $settings['display']['server_info'] option to settings.php
       Enable/Disable display of server info on all pages
- add: Default media for COD. Can track players by GUID now.
- fix: Improved COD parser.
- fix: Max string length in settings.php not working when colors were disabled.
- fix: Clicking on IPs in playerstat.php did not perform search.
- fix: missed some stats if playerID/name was longer than 100 characters. 
- chg: All the award definitions (default-awards.php in pub/games/*) has been
       updated to allow more flexibilty.


12 Nov 2004 - v0.30 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: Support for Call Of Duty and COD: United Offensive. Use -l cod option.
- add: Support for Medal Of Honor Allied Assault, Spearhead, Breakthrough etc?
       Use -l moh option.
- add: Clicking on IPs in playerstat will perform a search.
- fix: misc. html validation problems. Thanks fjoggen.
- chg: Award image extensions are not stored in the db anymore. So, now you can
       quickly change the award image to a different image format (gif,jpg,png)
       without having to update the awards db again. All the award definitions
       (default-awards.php in pub/games/*) has been updated.
- chg: Code clean up, merges etc. - Hopefully it didn't break anything.


06 Nov 2004 - v0.22 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: Config option to enable/disable ftp passive mode for remote downloading.
       You may have to enable passive mode on some ftp servers.
- add: Settings.php options to enable/disable mini gameslist and awardslist 
       on main page.
- add: Support for Quake 3 Arena: Excessive Plus mod. Thanks Easy for the color
       codes and character translations.
- add: Support for Quake 3 Arena: CPMA mod (accuracies work properly now).
- add: SOF2 Hitbox, Damage parsing.
- chg: HitBox improved and redefined to be more flexible. You need to reset 
       and reparse the logs again for hitbox to work properly.
- fix: Events are categorized better in sof2 (rocmod specifically)
- fix: Stats were not counted if playerID/name was longer than 100 characters. 
       Capped max playerID length to 100 for now. 


01 Nov 2004 - v0.21 (beta)
--------------------------

- fix: problems with the password routine of web access to vsp.php. 
       ReadME.txt has been updated with information regarding the new routine.


31 Oct 2004 - v0.20 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: Ability to update the stats even without shell access. Check ReadME.txt
- add: Remote downloading of logs, if log name provided is an FTP link/url. 
       Set the FTP username, password and download path in the config.
- add: HitBox to display player hit locations if the game log supports it.
       Added support for Half life, Enemy Territory (headshots only)
- add: Half Life media and definitions. Thanks Krillin!
- add: Various new entries to the config (pub/configs/cfg-default.php) and to 
       the theme settings (pub/themes/bismarck/settings.php).
- add: Random quotes on main page. Check settings.php
- add: A spiffy new avalanche logo and a couple more skins (camo & swat),
       courtesy of frostbite.
       I have also included some other skins i found on various sites. If the 
       authors of these skins have a problem with this, please email me and 
       I will remove it in the next release.
- chg: Changed some vsp settings so its less user error prone! 
       ex:- you don't have to set up the adodb_path in the cfg anymore, unless
            you want to use your own path for it.
- chg: Bismarck theme uses slightly altered avalanche skin by default now.
- fix: Fixed "cannot establish database connection" problems when using newer 
       PHP versions. If you got that error before even if everything on your
       end was right, try again with this version.
- fix: q3a 3wave damage given/taken > 9999 should work now.
- fix: lots of misc formatting of theme for better display.


23 Jun 2004 - v0.10 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: Various improvements to the Half Life Parser. 
       Partial Accuracy info added       
- fix: Possible bug with Player renaming in HalfLife.
- fix: Newer Halflife logging format caused vsp to not work properly and 
       display the game is empty message.
       It was caused by STEAM_ID_PENDING in the connect line
- fix: GUID searches in index.php
       Show complete GUIDs etc in playerstat etc on mouse hover


16 Jun 2004 - v0.09 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: -l q3a-battle option for Q3A BattleMod. You can track by ip, guid now.
- add: -l q3a-lrctf option for Q3A Loki's Revenge CTF.
- fix: Player Name searches with HalfLife should work now.
- fix: VSP did not work properly if script was not run from its own folder.
       Cron jobs, Award updates etc should work properly now even if VSP is 
       not run from its folder.


25 Apr 2004 - v0.08 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: sof2 media. Thanks rc!
- add: $cfg['parser']['use_most_used_playerName'] in config to use the
       most used playerName OR newest playerName as primary playerName
- add: -l client option for client logs - qconsole.log 
       (currently only supports default q3a and osp/threewave events).
       If you want more games to be added, post a request and link to a sample 
       log in the forums.
- add: wet - ETPRO log files should work now. You can track players by GUID 
       and IP as well.
- fix: misc. fixes and improvements in default theme php files.
- fix: playerName and I.P. search fixed and improved.
- fix: -l wet option should work now without erroring out.
- fix: custom config files were not working when called from default theme.


13 Apr 2004 - v0.07 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: $settings['display']['default_sort'] to settings.php. Can make the 
       default sort to fields other than skill now.
- add: search by GUID, if available.
- add: -l q3a-ra3 option for the newer Rocket Arena 3 versions (post v1.5).
       You can track ra3 stats by playerName and ip for now. Tracking by GUID 
       does not work. Game Time cannot be properly detected from the games.log
       Also, its a good idea to disable gamestats from displaying
       for ra3. It doesnt make much sense since teams in ra3 keeps changing
       a lot.
       Stats from the ra3.db file like accuracy and such are not supported yet
       because i dont think its possible to accurately match up the games.log
       with the stats in there. So ask the ra3 author to change the way the 
       stats are stored in the ra3.db as I cannot do much.
       The way it is right now is either you use the stats in games.log OR you
       use the one in ra3.db. And since ra3.db doesnt have enough stats, I chose
       to use the games.log stats unless ofcourse they make it so i can match
       them up properly.
       Also, in the future if you want to retrieve additional stats from the 
       ra3.db file, then you have to install and load php_sqlite.dll extension 
       from your php.ini
       You can get the dll for windows from 
       http://snaps.php.net/win32/PECL_STABLE/php_sqlite.dll
       If you are using linux (or if the above link failed for windows)
       visit http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.sqlite.php and http://sqlite.org/
       for more info on how to install it. 
       For windows, basically you download the dll and put it in your 
       php extensions directory ( for example:- c:/php/extensions/ )
       Then, in your php.ini specify:-
       extension_dir = "c:/php/extensions/"
       extension=php_sqlite.dll
- add: vsp version number and last update time displayed in default theme.
- add: -l wet option for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. Currently only 
       processes the default ET log entries. If anyone has log files that
       uses the ETPRO mod, send them to me via the forums.
- add: $settings['display']['color_names'] to default theme settings.php
       enable/disable colors in player names etc.
- add: display KillChart for 1v1s and FFAs as well.
- fix: -l q3a-threewave, ng = nailgun in accuracy stats. You need to rebuild
       the db again for older entries to be considered as the same.
- fix: role/icon images not displaying properly.
- fix: misc. problems in default theme php files.
- fix: Awards and Skill definitions for games other than q3a were broken


31 Mar 2004 - v0.06 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: $cfg['parser']['trackID'] option in cfg. You can now track players using
       their playerName, guid or ip (if available for that mod/game). If you
       change this option to use guid or ip, make sure that info gets logged in
       the logfile *AND* VSP has support for it, otherwise VSP will completely 
       ignore the current game since it cannot find the ID for a player.
       $cfg['parser']['trackID'] = 'playerName' is the default and that should
       work with any game/mod.
- add: -l q3a-freeze option to count all the MOD_UNKNOWN Kill: events as THAW
       instead of TeamKill for Freeze Tag and other such variants.
- add: -l q3a-ut option, partial support for Quake 3 Urban Terror Logs.
       I dont know what the line:-
        47:14 Flag: 8 1: team_CTF_blueflag
       means in the log. I'm guessing thats how CTF events are logged. One 
       of them is probably the client id of the player and the other one
       probably is the CTF event ID (capture,touch etc). Well, if 
       anyone knows what the 8 and 1 in the above line means, let me know
- add: q3a-threewave, q3a-ut guid tracking, although threewave seems to log two 
       different guids per cd key?
- chg: playerName search now searches through all the aliases as well.
       

24 Mar 2004 - v0.05 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: $cfg['parser']['use_original_playerID'] option in cfg to specify which
       playerID to use as the primary ID (originalPlayerID or currentPlayerID)
- chg: Display descriptive weapon names instead of weapon IDs in Awards
- chg: Games that are not yet defined by vsp will use pub/games/default/ 
- chg: Changed all the database/table name references to use lower case only
       inorder to avoid windows/unix portability issues
- chg: sof2: the Warmup: line doesn't reset the game and consider it invalid.
       If this is not right, let me know.
- fix: Display weapon accuracy even if there are no kills with that weapon
- fix: Award images are not fixed to be in images folder in awardset


17 Mar 2004 - v0.04 (beta)
--------------------------

- fix: Awards not updating properly when user defined variables are used.


16 Mar 2004 - v0.03 (beta)
--------------------------

- chg: Rewrote live log processing routines.
       New routines will not modify the log file at all. Instead it
       creates save states for the logfiles that you process in the
       logdata/ folder. As of now, if VSP is run with the option 
         -p livelog 1
       it will remember the location in the log file where the last stats
       was parsed from. If you want VSP to forget this save state, then you
       have to delete the corresponding save state file from the logdata/
       folder. The name is in the format savestate_<specialFormOfLogfileName>. 
       Deleting that file and running vsp again with livelog 1 option will 
       reparse the whole log again from the beginning. Also note that each 
       logfile will have a separate save state file under the logdata folder.
       Do not edit/modify the savestate files! If you dont want it, just 
       delete it. This also means the backuppath option is pretty much pointless
       now. The backuppath option does not do anything any more and is disabled
       for q3 engine based games.
- fix: Display of wrong playerNames in playerstats listings.
- fix: Misc. bugs :)
       

12 Mar 2004 - v0.02 (beta)
--------------------------

- add: More Awards to default q3 award definition.
- add: Ban List for Players. 
       Ignores all events by and against players listed in 
       pub/include/playerBanList-default.inc.php (default list).
- add: pub/themes/bismarck/settings.php for default theme settings.
       You can enable/disable display of game stats/list using 
       $settings['display']['gamestats'] in pub/themes/bismarck/settings.php
- add: Iconsets for q3 FFA (assuming Team 0 is FFA for q3)
- add: Overall accuracy award added to default award definition for  Quake 3.
- add: added a default index.html in the pub subfolder that will redirect 
       visitors to themes/bismarck/index.php via a simple java script.
- chg: Changed some of the skill values in default q3 skill definition.
- fix: Fixed handling of the character ^ in q3, hopefully.
- fix: Loads the default images properly for awards, roles, icons etc in default
       theme. Default images for these must be provide by the author of the 
       corresponding awardset, roleset or iconset.
- fix: The order in which awards were generated did not match the order in the
       definition php. Hence some awards did not have any value and did not 
       work. The order is preserved now.
- fix: Awards were not updating because data was not quoted properly.
- fix: fixed some php/html errors in default theme. Disabled NOTICE and WARNING
       errors in scripts.
- rem: Removed incomplete skins - camo, classic, swat. Will be back when 
       frostbite updates it!

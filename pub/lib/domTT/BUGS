These are the known bugs/issues in the DOM Tooltip library:

- Events start firing long before scripts have been loaded...can lead to script
  errors...this is really hard to get around, but if you are concerned, just
  check that page has loaded before each event

- Opera7 popups up a native tooltip title for the link, which goes over the custom tooltip
  (all you need to do is disable tooltips in the opera preferences)

- you cannot use the margin style on the body in Opera7, you have to use padding instead
  you can read over at opera.com why they don't support this...apparently not a legit style

- offset* properties do not account for margins, so styles with margins could lead to issues

- fading in and fading out in mozilla is somewhat flaky...it works but has flickering...this
  flickering is NOT the tooltip code, it is the rendering of the styles in mozilla...only time
  will help us here (this seems to be resolved in Firefox 1.0)

- inframe tips do not appear over top of the iframe in Opera and Konqueror
